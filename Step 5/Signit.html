    <h1>Going the left Way</h1>
    <p> You decide to go the left way. It takes you about 30 minutes to get home.</p>
      <p>But on the plus side you don't have to take any weird turns or corners. You just keep going straight until
      you reach your apartment complex. About 15 min. down the road you meet up with your neighbor who happened to be
    driving by.</p>
    <p> He offers you to give you a ride back home. Do you tak him up on the offer, 
      or turn him down and your own way?</p>
