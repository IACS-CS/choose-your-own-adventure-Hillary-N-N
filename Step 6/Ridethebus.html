    <h1>Riding on the bus</h1>
    <p>You decide to tough it out and go on the bus. But the stench that was
      linger smelt so bad, you almost threw up! Luckily you didn't, and held
      your breath for as long as you could. Once you make it to the bus stop,
      you let out a big sigh of relief and make your way home.</p>
