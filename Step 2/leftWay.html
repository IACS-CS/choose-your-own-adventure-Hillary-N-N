    <h1>Going the left Way</h1>
    <p> You decide to go the left way. It takes you about 30 minutes to get home.
    But on the plus side you don't have to take any weird turns or corners. You let your mom know your walking home, and go on your way. 
     About 15 minutes into your walk you pass by your neighbor.</p>
