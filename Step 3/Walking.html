    <h1>Walking Home</h1>
    <p>
      After pondering about whether to wait for bus or not you eventually decide
      to walk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Walking was going to be a little long, so you decide to grab a snack and
      drink. It happened to be all under all dollar.
    </p>
    <p>From the store your grabbed:</p>
    <ol>
      <li> A bag of chips</li>
      <li> A driink of juice</li>
      <li>1 pack of gum</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      When you walk to the register, a nice old lady offers to spot you. You
      keep asking the lady if its okay to and that she doesn't haven't. She
      insists and pays.
    </p>
    <p>
      You end thanking her a bunch of times, and head out. This made your trip
      much shorter.
