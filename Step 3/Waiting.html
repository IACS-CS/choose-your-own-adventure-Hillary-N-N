    <h1>Waiting for the bus</h1>
    <p> It took a bit longer for the bus to come to the supermarket. It took 40 min.</p>
    <p> Apprently, one of the passengers on the bus had an accident, something about 
      spilt juice.</p> 
      <p> Because of that, the whole bus stunk up with a foul odor. Everyone was covering their
        faces. Do you choose <a href= "../Step 6/Ridethebus.html">to ride the bus</a>, <a href= "../Step 7/Waitforbus.html">wait for the next bus</a>, 
        or <a href= "../Step 8/Callmom.html">call your mom for a ride home?</a>
