    <h1>Waiting for the bus</h1>
    <p> It took a bit longer for the bus to come to the supermarket. It took 40 min.</p>
    <p> Apprently, one of the passengers on the bus had an accident, something about 
      spilt juice.</p> 
      <p> Because of that, the whole bus stunk up with a foul odor. Everyone was covering their
        faces. At least you house was only 15 min. away by bus, so you saved yourself the trip!</p>
